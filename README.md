# Expenso defined by ChatBot
This code defines a budget dictionary to store your income and expenses, and a add_transaction function that allows you to add new transactions to the budget. It also defines a print_budget function that calculates the total income, expenses, and savings, and prints the details of each transaction.

To use the program, you can add new transactions by calling the add_transaction function with the type of transaction (income or expenses), the amount, and a description. Then, you can call the print_budget function to see a summary of your budget.

Note that this is a simple example, and it does not implement all of the features that a full budgeting app might have. It is intended to provide a basic introduction to the concepts involved in tracking spending and creating a budget.
